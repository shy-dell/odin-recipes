# odin-recipes

Prior to Project Start: 
- Project is build a basic recipe website using the HTML knowledge acquired thus far. 
- Will provide reflecion following project completion, as needed, and keep notes here. 

Notes: 
- create a folder to hold child sites called 'recipes'
- create a folder to hold images to reference called 'images'
- use .. to navigate to the parent directory, then reference other folders in said directory
- use touch ./folder/filename.html to create new recipe files

Publish webpage: 
- Go to Github Repo --> Settings --> Pages
- Change Branch from none to "main" and save
- this generally takes ~10 min but may take up to an hour
- if after an hour there is no update, then it may be because the file is not named index.html
